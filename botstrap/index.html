        <p>Global warming potential (GWP) is an index to measure of how much infrared thermal radiation a greenhouse gas
            would absorb over a given time frame after it has been added to the atmosphere (or emitted to the
            atmosphere). The GWP makes different greenhouse gases comparable with regards to their "effectiveness in
            causing radiative forcing".[1]:2232 It is expressed as a multiple of the radiation that would be absorbed
            by the same mass of added carbon dioxide (CO2), which is taken as a reference gas. Therefore, the GWP is one
            for CO2. For other gases it depends on how strongly the gas absorbs infrared thermal radiation, how quickly
            the gas leaves the atmosphere, and the time frame being considered.

            For example, methane has a GWP over 20 years (GWP-20) of 81.2[2] meaning that, for example, a leak of a
            tonne of methane is equivalent to emitting 81.2 tonnes of carbon dioxide measured over 20 years. As methane
            has a much shorter atmospheric lifetime than carbon dioxide, its GWP is much less over longer time periods,
            with a GWP-100 of 27.9 and a GWP-500 of 7.95.[2]:7SM-24

            The carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e or CO2eq or CO2-e) can be calculated from the GWP. For any gas, it is
            the mass of CO2 that would warm the earth as much as the mass of that gas. Thus it provides a common scale
            for measuring the climate effects of different gases. It is calculated as GWP times mass of the other gas.
